        Drawing is my favorite activity i do in my free time. i am good at designing characters, figures, film scenes etc. i draw since i was 4 year old. till today, i leveled up so much times in drawing, that, i have started digital arts. i use pencils, pens, colour pencils, erasers, sometimes, even fingertips! just to smooth the shadings i make with the pencils. i also make animations. i make other versions of original pictures too.

    My hand works as i am running on an empty field. the same as birds flying on the sky. the pencil with my hand makes a great team. It starts drawing as air roaming around. Making great designs like characters and portraits. I have sent my drawing to be published on our state newspaper many times. And as i draw good, most of the times i was the best artist in my school classes.

    WASSILY KANDINGSKY
    <br>
    I have my inspiration with sir wassily kandingsky. He was a great artist. I like the way he doodles. His paintings are very beautiful. Just like colourful animals. His paintings would be more beautiful, if it all was in street walls.
